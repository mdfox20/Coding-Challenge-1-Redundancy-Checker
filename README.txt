This program reads in the .py, .csv and .txt files in a specified directory and prints out a report with the number of identical lines found between each file pair and the content and location of those shared lines. The path for the directory is stored in a global variable at the top of the file, so the user must specify an existing path here before running. If there are no files in the directory, the program will print a message alerting the user to this. This program is written and should be run in Python 3.

In terms of efficiency, our program is structured such that if we have a line that is all whitespace, our program looks at it and just ignores it. We considered removing these lines, but then we would have had to implement some sort of way to keep track of the original line numbers, as deleting whitespace would shift the index of the lines in our lists. In the end, we decided to leave the whitespace in, as we thought the added time and space from whitespace removing and line spacing tracking steps would be too much, and wouldn’t pay off unless there were a lot of files that were mostly whitespace. In real life, most files aren’t mostly whitespace, so we decided to stay with our original method of not deleting the whitespace. 

We also only compare each pair of files once. For example, we run compare_files on files 1 and 3 but not files 3 and 1, because that would give the same result.
